<h2>About me :computer:</h2>
<p>
My name is Kaio Cesar. I am majoring in Systems Analysis and Development at Universidade Estácio de Sá.

At the beginning of the year 2022, I decided to focus my career as a Software Developer for Android mobile applications. And since then I've been creating applications using the <b>Kotlin language, Jetpack compose, Retrofit, Coroutines, SQLite, Dagger-Hilt, Firebase</b> and even the <b>Mvvm</b> architecture to structure my projects. And speaking of my projects, I have some really cool ones here in the repositories.
